Throughout the course, you will build from these foundations and master the basics of this widely used open source language, including data structures, flow, exploration, and wrangling. This is all supported with live coding and quizzes so you can be sure you know what you\'re doing. \\n\\nWhile the use of R continues to grow globally, PHS continues to secure the infrastructure and tools for everyone to make the best use of this technology. This course is suitable for everyone new to R and provides the knowledge to build topic specific skills.","link":"https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-learnr-intro/","f2f":"https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5JmmiLaHlezqJOh-fBWH8cGyhUQUlQMVNZMk1aTjdCMllRTFJNWkZKTFNSMy4u","online":"https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-learnr-intro/","image":"","type":["In-Person Course","Online Course"],"technology":"R","level":"1","packages":["base"],"tags":["r"],"prereqs":"none","timetable":"3 half days (plus a pre-course check)","materials":"https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/learnr-intro","related":[]},{"title":"Introduction to Git ","slug":"introduction-to-git","description":"A beginner\'s course for learning git (including GitHub and Gitea) from the basics.","overview":"In Introduction to Git, there is no assumption of any background in Git, or even version control. Instead, this introduces you to version control topics and provides a deeper understanding of how things work, all from the perspective of an R user. The practical elements of the course utilise the user interface on RStudio so, while there\'s no prerequisite on R, you should be familiar with the RStudio software. \\n\\nVersion control is a powerful tool across software engineering disciplines. At a high level, it allows you to keep track of changes, undoing them when necessary, and collaborating at scale. This course introduces you to Git as a version control tool (arguably the most popular), GitHub and Gitea. You\'ll learn about repositories, commits, branches, and pull requests.","link":"https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5JmibxHi_yzZ9Pvduh8IqoF_5UMklXNzQ3SjZUVDdEVzlIUUJHWVBSMVFMTCQlQCN0PWcu&embed=true","f2f":"https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5JmibxHi_yzZ9Pvduh8IqoF_5UMklXNzQ3SjZUVDdEVzlIUUJHWVBSMVFMTCQlQCN0PWcu","online":"","image":"","type":["In-Person Course"],"technology":"Git","level":"1","packages":[],"tags":["git"],"prereqs":"none","timetable":"1 half day (plus both a pre-course check and post-course drop-in)","materials":"https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/learn-git","related":["R","Python"]},{"title":"Data Visualisation in R","slug":"data-visualisation-in-r","description":"Learn about data viz using R.

Building from the Introduction to R course, this course covers the structure on which visualisations are built and then, more practically, how to actually build them. \\n\\nThe ggplot2 package is the primary R package that is used across the organisation and in this course. However, this package is built on the same underlying structure as the plotly package.

You can also include executable code chunks, allowing you to produce visualisations and analytical outputs. R Markdown is already widely used across the organisation, with templates available for publications, presentations, and even training course apps. \\n\\nIn this course you\'ll learn the foundations and practicalities of using R Markdown. While there\'s enough theory to understand how things work, there\'s practical exercises to get familiar and embed your learning. You\'ll need to do most of the practical exercises on RStudio (desktop or server) as the training app can\'t show the outputs.","link":"https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-learnr-rmarkdown/","f2f":"","online":"https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-learnr-rmarkdown/","image":"","type":["Online Course"],"technology":"R","level":"2","packages":["base","rmarkdown"],"tags":["r"],"prereqs":["Introduction to R"],"timetable":"","materials":"","related":[]},{"title":"PHS Methods","slug":"phs-methods","description":"The first step in taking R further.
