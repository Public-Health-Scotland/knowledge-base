Throughout the course, you will build from these foundations and master the basics of this widely used open source language, including data structures, flow, exploration, and wrangling. This is all supported with live coding and quizzes so you can be sure you know what you\'re doing. \\n\\nWhile the use of R continues to grow globally, PHS continues to secure the infrastructure and tools for everyone to make the best use of this technology.

Instead, this introduces you to version control topics and provides a deeper understanding of how things work, all from the perspective of an R user. The practical elements of the course utilise the user interface on RStudio so, while there\'s no prerequisite on R, you should be familiar with the RStudio software. \\n\\nVersion control is a powerful tool across software engineering disciplines. At a high level, it allows you to keep track of changes, undoing them when necessary, and collaborating at scale. This course introduces you to Git as a version control tool (arguably the most popular), GitHub and Gitea. You\'ll learn about repositories, commits, branches, and pull requests.","link":"https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5JmvpRU_LHr_5KrgEqWKwVEvJUOTdKTjRKMUZYUVlEM0E2NE9GQkdOVjBESCQlQCN0PWcu&embed=true","f2f":"https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5JmvpRU_LHr_5KrgEqWKwVEvJUOTdKTjRKMUZYUVlEM0E2NE9GQkdOVjBESCQlQCN0PWcu","online":"","image":"","type":["In-Person Course"],"technology":"Git","level":"1","packages":[],"tags":["git"],"prereqs":"none","timetable":"1 half day (plus both a pre-course check and post-course drop-in)","materials":"https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/learn-git","related":["R","Python"]},{"title":"Data Visualisation in R","slug":"data-visualisation-in-r","description":"Learn about data viz using R.
